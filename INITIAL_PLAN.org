#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil

* Overview

This is an AI-powered agentic research assistant designed to help users understand, summarize, and assess the impact of legislative texts, court rulings, and regulatory documents. It is suitable for policy researchers, legal advocates, journalists, and civil society organizations.

The application is designed for local development and testing with eventual deployment to a cloud environment like AWS (via ECS, Lambda, or Fargate). It uses Python and integrates LLM frameworks such as LangChain or LangGraph.

* Features

**1. Document Ingestion**
- Accepts legal or policy documents (PDFs, plain text, web URLs)
- Extracts structured text and metadata
- Handles multi-section documents (e.g. bill titles, amendments, findings)

**2. Language Model Pipeline**
- Uses LangChain agents to:
  - Extract entities (laws referenced, agencies, affected groups)
  - Identify key provisions and risks
  - Summarize the impact of the document in user-friendly language
  - Cross-reference external laws or precedents

**3. Use Cases**
- Summarizing a new bill and comparing it with existing law
- Identifying civil rights risks in new legislation
- Tracing how multiple laws interact on a specific topic (e.g., healthcare, surveillance)
- Producing media-ready or advocacy-ready summaries

**4. Interactive Querying**
- Users can ask natural language questions like:
  - “Who does this bill affect?”
  - “What are the privacy implications?”
  - “Is this consistent with the First Amendment?”

**5. Output Formats**
- Summary reports (Markdown, HTML, JSON)
- Citations with confidence scores
- Exports for use in newsletters, reports, or fact sheets

* Responsible AI Features

**1. Transparency and Traceability**
- Each output contains:
  - Source citations from the original text
  - Model confidence ratings
  - Chain-of-thought traces for each agent step

**2. Factuality Enforcement**
- Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over a trusted corpus (e.g. state law archives, Lexis-like sources)
- Summaries are constrained by source citations (no hallucinated opinions)

**3. Auditability**
- Intermediate agent decisions are logged and saved
- Can be replayed or inspected post-hoc

**4. User Warnings**
- If LLM confidence falls below a certain threshold, users are alerted:
  - “⚠️ This summary may omit relevant context. Please review the original section.”
- Documents are flagged if:
  - The model sees ambiguous or contradictory language
  - There's legal text that could require human review

**5. Privacy & Security**
- Locally processed data is sandboxed
- AWS cloud deployment includes IAM and encrypted S3 storage
- No third-party API calls made without user opt-in

**6. Human-in-the-Loop (Optional)**
- Flagged decisions can be reviewed by expert users
- Fine-tuning feedback loop possible with trace-backed corrections

* Roadmap
- [ ] Add integration with state and federal legislative APIs
- [ ] Enable cross-document comparison view
- [ ] Add a responsible AI dashboard (bias detection, decision logging)
- [ ] Provide test fixtures for common document types

* Technologies
- Python 3.11+
- LangChain or LangGraph
- OpenAI or Anthropic model integration
- PyPDF2, BeautifulSoup (for doc parsing)
- FAISS or Chroma for retrieval
- Pytest for test suite
- AWS: S3, Lambda/Fargate, CloudWatch

* Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Run setup script to create local virtual environment
3. Load example legal document (`examples/sample_bill.pdf`)
4. Start local app with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   python main.py
   #+END_SRC
5. View output in `outputs/summary.md`
