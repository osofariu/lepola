PART 2—ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION
SEC. 43201. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE.
(a) APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS.—There is hereby ap-
propriated to the Department of Commerce for fiscal year
2025, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise ap-
propriated, $500,000,000, to remain available until Sep-
tember 30, 2034, to modernize and secure Federal infor-
mation technology systems through the deployment of
commercial artificial intelligence, the deployment of auto-
mation technologies, and the replacement of antiquated
business systems in accordance with subsection (b).
(b) AUTHORIZED USES.—The Secretary of Com-
merce shall use the funds appropriated under subsection
(a) for the following:
(1) To replace or modernize, within the Depart-
ment of Commerce, legacy business systems with
state-of-the-art commercial artificial intelligence sys-
tems and automated decision systems.
(2) To facilitate, within the Department of
Commerce, the adoption of artificial intelligence
models that increase operational efficiency and serv-
ice delivery.
(3) To improve, within the Department of Com-
merce, the cybersecurity posture of Federal informa-
tion technology systems through modernized archi-
tecture, automated threat detection, and integrated
artificial intelligence solutions.
(c) MORATORIUM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in para-
graph (2), no State or political subdivision thereof
may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning ontember 30, 2034, to modernize and secure Federal infor-
mation technology systems through the deployment of
commercial artificial intelligence, the deployment of auto-
mation technologies, and the replacement of antiquated
business systems in accordance with subsection (b).
(b) AUTHORIZED USES.—The Secretary of Com-
merce shall use the funds appropriated under subsection
(a) for the following:
(1) To replace or modernize, within the Depart-
ment of Commerce, legacy business systems with
state-of-the-art commercial artificial intelligence sys-
tems and automated decision systems.
(2) To facilitate, within the Department of
Commerce, the adoption of artificial intelligence
models that increase operational efficiency and serv-
ice delivery.
(3) To improve, within the Department of Com-
merce, the cybersecurity posture of Federal informa-
tion technology systems through modernized archi-
tecture, automated threat detection, and integrated
artificial intelligence solutions.
(c) MORATORIUM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in para-
graph (2), no State or political subdivision thereof
may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning on
the date of the enactment of this Act, any law or
regulation of that State or a political subdivision
thereof limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into
interstate commerce.
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph (1)
may not be construed to prohibit the enforcement
of—
(A) any law or regulation that—
(i) the primary purpose and effect of
which is to—
(I) remove legal impediments to,
or facilitate the deployment or oper-
ation of, an artificial intelligence
model, artificial intelligence system, or
automated decision system; or
(II) streamline licensing, permit-
ting, routing, zoning, procurement, or
reporting procedures in a manner that
facilitates the adoption of artificial in-
telligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision sys- tems;
(ii) does not impose any substantive
design, performance, data-handling, docu-
mentation, civil liability, taxation, fee, or
other requirement on artificial intelligence
models, artificial intelligence systems, or
automated decision systems unless such re-
quirement—
(I) is imposed under Federal law;
or
(II) in the case of a requirement
imposed under a generally applicable
law, is imposed in the same manner
on models and systems, other than ar-
tificial intelligence models, artificial
intelligence systems, and automated
decision systems, that provide com-
parable functions to artificial intel-
ligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision sys-
tems; and
(iii) does not impose a fee or bond un-
less—
(I) such fee or bond is reasonable
and cost-based; and
(II) under such fee or bond, arti-
ficial intelligence models, artificial in-
telligence systems, and automated de-
cision systems are treated in the same
manner as other models and systems
that perform comparable functions; or
(B) any provision of a law or regulation to
the extent that the violation of such provision
carries a criminal penalty.
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:
(1) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.—The term ‘‘ar-
tificial intelligence’’ has the meaning given such
term in section 5002 of the National Artificial Intel-
ligence Initiative Act of 2020 (15 U.S.C. 9401).
(2) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODEL.—The
term ‘‘artificial intelligence model’’ means a software
component of an information system that imple-
ments artificial intelligence technology and uses
computational, statistical, or machine-learning tech-
niques to produce outputs from a defined set of in-
puts.
(3) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM.—The
term ‘‘artificial intelligence system’’ means any data
system, hardware, tool, or utility that operates, in
whole or in part, using artificial intelligence.
(4) AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEM.—The term
‘‘automated decision system’’ means any computa-
tional process derived from machine learning, statis-
tical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intel-
ligence that issues a simplified output, including a
score, classification, or recommendation, to materi-
ally influence or replace human decision making.
